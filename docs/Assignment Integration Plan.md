# Assignment Integration Plan (Updated)

## Current Implementation Insights

### User Assignment System
1. **Database Structure**
   - `users` table:
     - Key fields: `id`, `email`, `name`, `role`, `department`, `is_active`
     - Department and active status are crucial for assignment filtering
   - `team_members` table:
     - Links users to teams: `team_id`, `user_id`, `role`, `joined_at`

2. **TeamSelect Component**
   - Core reusable component for user/team assignments
   - Features:
     - Department-based filtering
     - Active user filtering
     - Cross-department assignments for admins
     - Visual separation of name and department in dropdowns
     - Support for both user and team assignments
     - Enhanced UI with better spacing and borders

3. **Assignment Rules**
   - Regular users can only assign within their department
   - Admins can assign across departments
   - Only active users are shown in selection
   - Teams are filtered by department
   - Department information is passed with assignments

4. **Implementation Pattern**
   ```typescript
   // Component Props
   interface TeamSelectProps {
     onSelect: (selection: { 
       type: 'user' | 'team', 
       id: string, 
       department?: string 
     }) => void
     currentDepartment?: string
     allowCrossDepartment?: boolean
   }
   ```

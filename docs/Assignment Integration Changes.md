# Assignment Integration Changes

## 1. TeamSelect Component Updates
- File: `src/components/ui/team-select.tsx`
- Current Working State:
  - Displays users and teams in a dropdown
  - Shows department information for each option
  - Handles selection of users and teams
  - Returns full UUIDs for selected items

## 2. Contact Service Updates
- File: `src/lib/supabase/services/contacts.ts`
- Current Working State:
  - Basic contact fetching with RLS enabled
  - Contact creation and updates working
  - Contact deletion working
  - Basic assignment storage (UUID and type)

## 3. Contact Display Updates
- Files affected:
  - `src/components/contacts/contact-details-modal.tsx`
  - `src/app/(main)/contacts/page.tsx`
- Current Working State:
  - Displays assigned UUIDs (needs update to show names)
  - Shows assignment type (user/team)
  - Basic layout for assignment information

## Next Steps
1. Update contact service to join with users and teams tables
2. Update contact display to show assigned names instead of UUIDs
3. Add department-based filtering
4. Implement cross-department assignment rules

## Testing Steps
1. Create a new contact
2. Verify contact is saved with assignment
3. Verify contact loads properly
4. Verify assignments persist after refresh

I need help restoring the Bonnymans CRM layout to its correct state. The layout uses Material-UI (MUI) with the following specifications:

1. Core Layout Structure:
- AppBar: Fixed position, 48px height, with blur effect and gradient background
- Drawer: Permanent variant, collapsible (240px open, 73px closed)
- Main Content: Flexbox layout with proper spacing from AppBar and 1 unit padding

2. Critical Measurements:
- Drawer Width: 240px (open) / 73px (closed)
- AppBar Height: 48px
- Transition Duration: 225ms
- Z-index: AppBar (1200), Drawer (1100)

3. Visual Elements:
- Gradient backgrounds for dark/light modes
- Blur effects (backdrop-filter: blur(8px))
- Smooth transitions for drawer open/close
- Proper border styling (1px solid with opacity)
- Rounded corners (12px) for menu items
- Logo (40x40px, circular)

4. Navigation Menu Styling:
- Menu items with icons and text
- Text hidden when drawer collapsed
- Active state highlighting with custom color scheme
- Text contrast in dark mode: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)
- Text contrast in light mode: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87)
- Hover effects maintain original icon colors

Please help restore these layout specifications while maintaining the existing functionality. The layout should be responsive and maintain proper z-index layering.

Key files to check:
1. /src/components/layout/Layout.tsx
2. /src/components/layout/layoutStyles.ts
3. /src/components/layout/layoutConstants.ts
4. /src/theme/ThemeContext.tsx

Backup files are available at:
/src/backups/layout_backup/layoutStyles.backup.ts
/src/backups/layout_backup/layoutConstants.backup.ts
```

### Additional Recovery Notes:

1. **Quick Checks**:
   - Verify AppBar height is 48px
   - Check gradient backgrounds
   - Test drawer collapse/expand
   - Verify z-index layering
   - Test dark/light mode
   - Verify menu text contrast
   - Check icon color scheme

2. **Common Issues**:
   - Z-index conflicts: Ensure AppBar (1200) > Drawer (1100)
   - Transition glitches: Check duration (225ms)
   - Blur effects missing: Verify backdrop-filter
   - Layout shifts: Check margin calculations
   - Theme inconsistencies: Verify ThemeContext integration
   - Menu text visibility: Check contrast values
   - Icon colors: Ensure original color scheme is maintained

3. **Style Priorities**:
   - Maintain blur effects
   - Preserve gradient backgrounds
   - Keep smooth transitions
   - Ensure proper spacing
   - Maintain responsive behavior
   - Preserve menu text contrast
   - Keep original icon color scheme

4. **Recovery Steps**:
   1. First try restoring from backup files in /src/backups/layout_backup/
   2. If backups are unavailable, use the specifications above
   3. Test all interactions after restoration
   4. Verify dark/light mode transitions
   5. Check menu item hover and active states

# Auth System Implementation

This directory contains the isolated authentication system implementation.

## Directory Structure
```
/auth-system
  /components     # Isolated auth components
  /hooks         # Auth-related hooks
  /lib          # Auth utilities
  /pages        # Auth pages (login, register)
  /types        # TypeScript types
```

## Implementation Rules
1. No modifications to core files
2. All components must be isolated
3. No shared dependencies with main app
4. Test each component in isolation
5. Get approval before integration

## Current Status
- [ ] Phase 1: Setup and Verification
  - [x] Created isolated directory
  - [ ] Verified no conflicts
  - [ ] Documented structure

## Next Steps
1. Create basic auth page structure
2. Implement auth logic
3. Setup auth routing
4. Create auth state handler
5. Setup redirect flow

# Admin Integration Implementation Guide

## 1. Current State Analysis
- [x] Admin components located in `/src/components/admin/`
  - UserManagement.tsx
  - TeamManagement.tsx
  - CreateTeamModal.tsx
- [x] Navigation in Sidebar.tsx with admin section
- [x] API routes in `/api/admin/`
- [x] Authentication using NextAuth.js with role-based access

## 2. Migration Goals
- [ ] Move admin components to new three-column layout
- [ ] Maintain existing authentication and authorization
- [ ] Keep current navigation functionality
- [ ] Ensure API routes continue working

## 3. Risk Assessment
### Potential Issues:
1. **Authentication**
   - ✓ NextAuth.js integration is solid
   - ✓ Role-based checks already in place
   - ! Need to enhance middleware protection

2. **Navigation**
   - ✓ Admin links already properly structured
   - ✓ isAdmin check in place
   - ! Need to update active state handling

3. **API Routes**
   - ✓ Separate from frontend routes
   - ✓ Won't be affected by migration
   - ! Verify admin role checks

## 4. Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Preparation
- [x] Add admin route protection to middleware
  - Added role check for /admin/* routes
  - Updated matcher configuration
  - Added 403 response for unauthorized access
- [x] Update navigation active state checks
  - Added nested route support
  - Fixed admin section highlighting
  - Improved path matching logic
- [x] Create new admin route structure

### Phase 2: Migration
- [x] Create new admin layout in (main)
- [x] Move UserManagement component
- [ ] Move TeamManagement component
- [ ] Test role-based access

### Phase 3: Testing
- [ ] Verify navigation works
- [ ] Test admin role access
- [ ] Check API functionality
- [ ] Validate UI in three-column layout

## 5. Rollback Plan
- Keep original components until testing complete
- Document all changes for potential rollback
- Test both old and new paths before removing old ones

## 6. Success Criteria
- [ ] Admin pages use three-column layout
- [ ] All admin functions working
- [ ] Navigation maintains current behavior
- [ ] Role-based access properly enforced
- [ ] No disruption to API functionality

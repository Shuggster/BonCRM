# Authentication Implementation Status

## Current State (Implemented)
- NextAuth.js for authentication with credentials provider
- Users stored in Supabase database with proper schema
- No dependency on Supabase Auth
- Department and role-based access control implemented
- User management interface complete and functional

## Implemented Architecture

### 1. Authentication Layer
✅ NextAuth.js as sole authentication provider
✅ JWT strategy with session management
✅ Users table with bcrypt password hashing
✅ Role and department-based access control

### 2. Security Model
✅ Server-side only database access
✅ Supabase service role key protected
✅ API routes with proper validation
✅ Session-based role verification

### 3. Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('admin', 'manager', 'operational')),
  department TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (department IN ('management', 'sales', 'accounts', 'trade_shop')),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Completed Features

### User Management Interface
✅ User creation with validation
✅ Role and department selection
✅ User listing with grid layout
✅ Delete user functionality
✅ Real-time status updates

### Access Control
✅ Admin: Full system access
✅ Manager: Department-level access
✅ Operational: Basic access
✅ Role-based route protection

### Security Implementation
✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
✅ Protected API routes
✅ Session validation
✅ CSRF protection

## Remaining Tasks

### Phase 1: Enhanced Security
1. Implement password reset functionality
2. Add password strength requirements
3. Enable 2FA for admin accounts
4. Add session activity monitoring

### Phase 2: User Experience
1. Add bulk user import/export
2. Implement user activity logging
3. Add enhanced filtering and search
4. Improve error messaging

### Phase 3: Monitoring
1. Add failed login attempt tracking
2. Implement IP-based access controls
3. Add audit logging for sensitive operations
4. Create admin dashboard for security events

## Best Practices (Implemented)

### API Routes
✅ Consistent error handling
✅ Input validation
✅ Session verification
✅ Role-based access control

### Database Access
✅ Server-side only operations
✅ Prepared statements
✅ Data validation
✅ Error handling

### Security
✅ No client-side sensitive operations
✅ Protected API routes
✅ Secure password handling
✅ Session management
